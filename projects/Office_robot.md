# Office Assistant

## Problem
Most robotic platforms don't offer much in terms of pragmatism, especially the  
ones that are anthropromorphic. Small tasks like getting whiteboard markers or  
post-it notes for a conference room, or moving small packages, while trival can  
be eliminated with a minimal amount of effort.

## Solution
A small robot office assistance with mobile manipulator.
