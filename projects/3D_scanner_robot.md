# 3D Scanning Robot

## Problem
Could we scan people in 3D, rig the model and place them on a virtual dance floor in less than 5 minutes?  
Explore the application of and UX of full body 3D scanning of people.

## Solution
_Phase 1:_  
Create a full body 3D scanner and processing pipeline.

_Phase 2:_  
Make it mobile both the scanner and an application

**Scanning Mechanisms:**  
_Phase 1:_  
The first involved the creation of a static base where the user stood in the center and an arm that  
extended out from the based which held a linear actuation mechanism was use to move the scanner  
up and down. The arm would move around the user in 360 degrees with a and LED strip that would  
illuminate the scanned aread uniformly.  

_Phase 2:_  
Reduce the scanner for shipping to Cannes France. Make it a robot that rotates the linear actuator around a user.

**Applications:**  
_Phase 1:_  
A desktop application that would display the virtual dancefloor and add in new "dancers" as scans were  
completed and processed.

_Phase 2:_  
Created a companion Mobile application that allowed users to view the dancefloor inf Google Cardboard VR,  
set custom dances, or have "dance offs" with other selected scanned avatars. Improved the backend processing pipeline.
