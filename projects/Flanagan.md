## Problem
Client needed a more interesting way to couple the brick and morter UX with  
a large digital userbase.

## Solution
Create a web app for an in-store pilot on an iPad to test the UX and viability of the product.  
The app allowed users to answer some questions to give inspiration to an AI chef that could  
create new drinks that had never been tasted before.
