## Problem
Smart watches at the time were pretty useless yet were packing tons of sensors.  
How could we put them to good use? Could we make it so anyone could add custom gestures?

## Solution
Create a gesture recognition demo that showcased how smart watches could be used to control or command  
by way of motion stemming from a users' wrist. Created a gesture learning / classifier that used the  
smart watches IMU sensors.
